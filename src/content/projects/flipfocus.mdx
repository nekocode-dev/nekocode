## Overview

FlipFocus reimagines how we learn with flashcards. Built with privacy at its core, it works completely offline while delivering a beautiful, distraction-free learning experience.

## Problem

Most flashcard apps require accounts, constant internet connection, and harvest user data. Students and lifelong learners deserve better - a tool that respects their privacy while actually helping them learn more effectively.

## Solution

FlipFocus stores everything locally on your device. No accounts, no cloud sync, no tracking. Just you and your learning. The spaced repetition algorithm adapts to your memory patterns, showing cards exactly when you need to review them.

## Key Features

- **Offline-First**: Works anywhere, anytime. Your data never leaves your device.
- **Spaced Repetition**: Science-backed algorithm maximizes long-term retention.
- **Beautiful Cards**: Rich text, images, and audio support for engaging content.
- **Import Anywhere**: Bring flashcards from Anki, Quizlet, or CSV files.
- **Dark Mode**: Easy on your eyes during late-night study sessions.
- **Progress Tracking**: Visualize your learning journey with detailed stats.

## Results

Currently in active development with a focus on crafting the best possible learning experience. Beta testing begins Q1 2026.

## Learnings

Building offline-first requires rethinking everything - from data sync to conflict resolution. The constraint of no backend forces creative solutions that ultimately benefit users.
