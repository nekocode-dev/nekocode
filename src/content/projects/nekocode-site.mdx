## Overview

NekoCode is more than a portfolio - it s a showcase of craft. Every project tells a story, every interaction feels intentional, and every pixel serves a purpose.

## Problem

Most developer portfolios are either boring galleries of screenshots or over-engineered monstrosities. Neither serves the actual goal: helping visitors understand what you build and why you build it.

## Solution

Case studies first, not a gallery. Each project gets its own dedicated page with the full story - problem, solution, process, and results. Visitors can filter by technology, platform, or project type to find exactly what interests them.

## Key Features

- **Bento Grid Layout**: Modern, modular design that adapts to any content
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Respects system preferences with manual toggle
- **Blazing Fast**: Static site generation with Astro for instant loads
- **Fully Accessible**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliant
- **Content-Driven**: Add new projects with just Markdown files

## Results

Lighthouse scores of 95+ across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. LCP under 1.5s on mobile connections.

## Learnings

Simplicity wins. The best portfolio is one that gets out of the way and lets the work speak for itself.
