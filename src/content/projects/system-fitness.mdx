## Overview

SYSTEM transforms boring workout routines into an adventure. Inspired by Solo Leveling's daily quest system, every rep counts toward leveling up your real-world character.

## Problem

Fitness apps feel like chores. They track data but fail to motivate. Users start strong but abandon them within weeks because there is no compelling reason to keep coming back.

## Solution

Gamification done right. SYSTEM gives you daily contracts - workout quests you must complete or face penalties. Real-time pose detection ensures you are actually doing the exercises. Progress feels tangible as you watch your character grow stronger.

## Key Features

- **Daily Contracts**: Randomly generated workout quests
- **Real-Time Verification**: ML-powered pose detection counts reps
- **Class System**: Fighter, Strider, or Shadow - each with unique training
- **Gates & Bosses**: Weekly challenges with serious rewards
- **Penalty System**: Miss workouts and face consequences

## Results

Currently in development with real-time verified pose detection working for key exercises. Beta testing Q2 2026.

## Learnings

The best motivation is intrinsic. Gamification should enhance the natural satisfaction of progress, not replace it with artificial rewards.
